# Vue-task-management-app

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a task management application using Vue 3 and a JSON server backend. Users can seamlessly add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed within the application. This project delves into essential Vue 3 features such as components, reactivity, routing, and JSON server integration for data persistence.

## Key Features

### Task Management

* **Task List:** Display a comprehensive list of tasks along with their titles and completion status.

* **Add Task:** Empower users to add new tasks, including their title and initial status (not completed).

* **Edit Task:** Facilitate task editing, allowing users to modify task titles.

* **Delete Task:** Provide the ability to delete tasks effortlessly.

* **Mark as Completed:** Enable users to mark tasks as completed or revert completed tasks to an incomplete state.

* **Task Count:** Display the total number of tasks alongside the count of completed tasks.

### Navigation

* **Routing:** Implement Vue Router to seamlessly navigate between different views, such as the Task List and Add Task view.

## Backend Integration

* **JSON Server:** Set up a JSON server to handle task data storage.

* **CRUD Operations:** Implement routes for tasks, enabling CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and storing data in a JSON file.

* **API Requests:** Utilize Axios or another HTTP library to make API requests to the JSON server from the Vue application, facilitating task data retrieval and updates.

## Additional Challenges

* **Authentication:** Integrate user authentication to control task creation and management.

* **Validation:** Implement validation for task titles, ensuring a minimum length requirement.

* **Filtering:** Provide task filtering based on completion status (completed or not completed).

* **Sorting:** Implement sorting options, allowing users to sort tasks by title or status.

## Technologies

* **Vue 3:** Leverage Vue 3 for building the user interface and managing reactivity.

* **Vue Router:** Implement Vue Router to enable seamless navigation between views.

* **JSON Server:** Utilize JSON Server as the backend for storing task data.

* **Axios or HTTP library:** Employ Axios or another HTTP library to make API requests to the JSON server.

## Benefits

* **JSON Server Integration:** Utilizing a JSON server as the backend adds complexity and valuable experience in working with RESTful APIs, enhancing your full-stack development skills.
